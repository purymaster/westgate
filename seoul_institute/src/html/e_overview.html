				<p class="indent">
					The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the shaky foundations on which our current social system, i.e.
					the global liberal order, is built. Its modus operandi, the so-called self-regulating market, not
					only malfunctioned but also accelerated the social instability across the world. In the immediate
					aftermath of the outbreak, the intricately interwoven global financial markets were sinking into
					total chaos and panic. As the prices of most traded assets such as stocks, bonds, oil, and commodity
					futures plunged, they were indeed teetering on the brink of collapse. Job markets also greatly
					aggravated the chaotic situation. Amid growing uncertainty of the global economy, hundreds of
					millions of people worldwide lost their jobs. In the US alone, the guardian of the liberal world
					order, the unemployment insurance weekly claims at its peak in May soared to about 25 million. The
					global trading market was no exception. The global supply chain, one of the main pillars of the
					neoliberal globalization, virtually ground to a halt – for a short time period, though. Ironically,
					many of the world’s largest economies suffered this disruption more than others did. Failing to
					procure necessary medical equipment such as masks and ventilators on its own, they just stood
					helpless to act against the virus.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p class="indent">
					Running counter to the neoliberal mantra, the recent disaster has shown that “free markets” could
					not have managed to survive without heavy “government intervention” including zero interest rate,
					unlimited quantitative easing, pandemic subsidy programs, and the central banks’ unlimited
					bond-buying plans. What if another wave of severer “external shocks” is coming? It is said that the
					COVID-19 pandemic is just the tip of the iceberg. Catastrophic ecological disasters, which may
					exterminate human species on Earth, loom large. It seems highly doubtful that a society blindly
					pursuing profits and economic growth can cope with them. It is not a cure for the problems but the
					root cause of them.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p class="indent">
					Although the governments across the world have been playing a central role in dealing with the
					pandemic, and preventing societal collapse, their actions are still designed to get back to
					“normal,” that is, the growth-oriented market society; the so-called “new normal” mostly refers to
					the “untact” industry-centered market society. Indeed, they succeeded in recovering their economies
					but only partially. For instance, the US stock market indexes keep hitting record highs while its
					real economy remains in a desperate situation like the Great Depression. Regardless of policymakers’
					intention, the consequences of their actions on the virus and its negative social impacts have
					widened the gap between the rich and the poor in terms of both wealth and health. Whereas the
					wealthy have become richer with the governments’ unlimited supports for the financial sector, the
					vulnerable populations, by losing jobs and incomes, have been disproportionately hit hard. As many
					statistical analyses have shown, the latter in poor living conditions were far more exposed to the
					virus than the former.
					In order to prepare for future disasters and emergencies, we need fundamental social change - a
					transition from a profit-oriented society to a “good-life-oriented” one. The former would exacerbate
					social problems as well as environmental crises. Unless structural problems immanent in the liberal
					order are addressed, “state interventionism” would fall short of what is required for the social
					change we need. In other words, if atomized individualism, the sanctification of private property,
					the myth of the invisible hand, and plutocracy remains intact, it is of no use for the state to be
					in the driver’s seat. A new society needs a new philosophy, a new view of the world that enables
					human beings to live in harmony with nature; that puts people before profits; that replaces the
					unfair, unlevel playing field of the current society with fairer, level playing one; that lays the
					foundation for organizing society collectively in a more democratic way.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p class="indent">
					As the slogan of the World Social Forum which was put forward in opposition to the neoliberal motto
					of “TINA,” another world is possible. And it is high time to start building a new world. Considering
					the urgency of the climate crisis, there may not be another chance.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p class="indent">
					In light of what was mentioned above, the Seoul Institute (SI) on behalf of the City of Seoul is to
					launch a project to put our heads together, which is named the Seoul Platform for Initiating
					Discourses on Equitable and Resilient Society (SPIDERS). SPIDERS would aim to be the web of wisdom
					for a better future.<br><br>
