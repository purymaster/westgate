					<span>About “SPIDERS”</span>
				</h3>
				<p class="indent">
					The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the shaky foundations on which our current
					social system, i.e. the global liberal order, is built. Its modus operandi, the so-called
					self-regulating market, not only malfunctioned but also accelerated the social
					instability across the world. In the immediate aftermath of the outbreak, the
					intricately interwoven global financial markets were sinking into total chaos and
					panic. As the prices of most traded assets such as stocks, bonds, oil, and
					commodity futures plunged, the markets were indeed teetering on the brink of
					collapse. Job markets also greatly aggravated the chaotic situation. Amid growing
					uncertainty of the global economy, hundreds of millions of people worldwide lost
					their jobs. In the US, the guardian of the liberal world order, alone, the
					unemployment insurance weekly claims soared to about 25 million at its peak in
					May. The global trading market was no exception. The global supply chain, one of
					the main pillars of the neoliberal globalization, for a short period at least, virtually
					ground to a halt. Ironically, many of the world’s largest economies suffered this
					disruption more than others did. Failing to procure necessary medical
					equipment such as masks and ventilators on their own, they stood helpless to act
					against the virus.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p class="indent">
					Running counter to the neoliberal mantra, the recent disaster has exposed that “free
					markets” could not have managed to survive without heavy government intervention
					that includes zero interest rates, unlimited quantitative easing, pandemic subsidy
					programs, and the central banks’ unlimited bond-buying plans. Yet it is said that the
					COVID-19 pandemic is just the tip of the iceberg. What if we are facing another
					wave of external shocks, this time severer than COVID-19? Catastrophic ecological
					disasters which may exterminate human species on Earth loom large. It is highly
					unlikely that a society blindly pursuing profits and economic growth can cope with
					them. It is not a cure for the problems but the root cause of them. <br><br>
				</p>
				<p class="indent">
					Although governments across the world have been playing crucial roles in dealing
					with the pandemic and preventing societal collapse, their actions are still focused on
					getting back to “normal”: the growth-oriented market society. The so-called “new
					normal” mostly refers to an “untact” industry-centered market society. Indeed, they
					succeeded in recovering their economies but only partially. For instance, the US
					stock market indexes keep hitting record highs while its real economy remains in a
					desperate situation akin to the Great Depression. Regardless of policymakers’
					intentions, their actions aimed to combat COVID-19 and its negative social impacts
					have widened the gap between the rich and the poor in terms of both wealth and
					health. Whereas the wealthy have become richer with the governments’ unlimited
					support for the financial sector, the vulnerable population, who lost jobs and income,
					have been disproportionately suffered. As many statistical analyses have shown, the
					latter was far more exposed to the virus than the former.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p class="indent">
					In order to brace for future disasters and emergencies, we need fundamental social
					change - a transition from a profit-oriented society to a “good-life-oriented” one. The
					former is exacerbating social problems as well as environmental crises. Unless
					structural problems immanent in the liberal order are addressed, “state
					interventionism” will fall short of what is required for the social change we need. In
					other words, if atomized individualism, the sanctification of private property, the myth
					of the invisible hand, and plutocracy remain intact, it is of no use for the state to
					be in the driver’s seat. A new society needs a new philosophy, a new view of the
					world that enables human beings to live in harmony with nature; that puts people
					before profits; that replaces the unfair, unlevel playing field of the current society
					with a fairer, level one; and that which lays the foundation for organizing the society
					collectively in a more democratic way.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p class="indent">
					As the slogan of the World Social Forum which was put forward in opposition to the
					neoliberal motto of “TINA” proclaims, “another world is possible.” And it is high time
					to start building a new world. Considering the urgency of the climate and societal
					crisis, there may not be another chance.<br><br>
				</p>
				<p class="indent">
					In light of what was mentioned above, the Seoul Institute (SI) on behalf of the City
					of Seoul is launching a project to put our heads together. The project, “Seoul
					Platform for Initiating Discourses on Equitable and Resilient Society (SPIDERS),”
					aspires to be a web of wisdom for a better future.
