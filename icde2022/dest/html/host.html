									Since its inception in 1972 as Korea’s first national distance education university, Korea National Open University (KNOU) has been a solid pillar for higher education system of Korea for the past 50 years. During that time, KNOU has produced more than 800,000 talented graduates and contributed immensely to the development of the country and to the popularization of college education in Korea. In addition to being one of the world’s top ten mega universities, KNOU is being benchmarked by nations around the world as an exemplary model of a successful distance education university.
								</p>
								<p>
									Based on its accomplishments and history, KNOU is preparing for a new start-a leap forward in the year 2022 which marks the 50th anniversary of its foundation. As “The Hub University of Knowledge Networks that Opens the Age of Wisdom” KNOU will establish its great stature as the hub of knowledge production, interchange, and sharing. Based on its recent experiences and achievements, KNOU will establish a future-oriented, state-of-the art distance education campus and further upgrade its role as a hub university of lifelong education.
								</p>
								<p>
									With the advent of a knowledge-information society, the world today has become a place in which the entire population is pursuing lifelong education. Moving beyond the mission of making higher education available to the general public, KNOU will make every effort to lead our nation toward becoming a lifelong learning society. KNOU dreams of a beautiful world where people live in harmony and become a driving force in realizing Korea’s educational dreams. Furthermore, KNOU will continue to strive even more to earn the affection and trust of the people as a university that is continuously involved in research that provides an optimal educational environment.
								</p>
								<p>
									We will remain open to and shared by Koreans and the global community and truly become “the Knowledge Network Hub University that Opens the Age of Wisdom.”
