                            is unfolding globally. Education is no exception. EdTech has now passed the point of being a
                            buzzword in the community as it becomes a substantial factor for scalable education,
                            increased efficiency and development of personalized learning paths adapted to learners
                            needs. Against this backdrop, educational leaders come together to discuss their roles in
                            light of the crisis through innovative approaches reflected by the latest developments of
