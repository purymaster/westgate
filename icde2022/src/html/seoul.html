                            It was in 1395, three years after the Joseon Dynasty was founded by King Taejo (Yi

                            of the newly founded dynasty moved from Gaeseong to Seoul (then known as Hanyang). With
                            Mount Bugaksan to its rear and Mount Namsan in the foreground, the site of Gyeongbokgung
                            Palace was at the heart of Seoul and, indeed, deemed auspicious according to the traditional
                            practice of geomancy.
