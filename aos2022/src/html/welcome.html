                        Dear Colleagues and Friends,
                    </p>
                    <p class="txt">
                        It is with great delight that we invite you to join us on the momentous occasion of the 2nd
                        International Congress of the Asian Oncology Society (AOS 2022), in conjunction with the 48th
                        Annual Meeting of the Korean Cancer Association, to be held from June 16 to 18, 2022, in Seoul,
                        Korea.
                    </p>
                    <p class="txt">
                        After a successful launch as a unified organization of the APFOCC (Asian and Pacific Federation
                        of Organizations for Cancer Research and Control) and ACOS (Asian Clinical Oncology Society) in
                        2019, the AOS has now become the most authoritative and representative organization of oncology
                        societies in Asia. Most noteworthy, in the face of the challenge of COVID-19, the AOS
                        successfully held its first international congress (AOS 2020) in November 2020 virtually.
                    </p>
                    <p class="txt">
                        In 2022, the AOS and Korea Cancer Association (KCA) are confident that we will overcome this
                        pandemic and finally meet in-person at AOS 2022. Following in our growing success, we truly
                        believe AOS 2022 will be the best place for all our participants, from world-renowned speakers
                        to young investigators to clinical and basic researchers in the field of Oncology, to
                        collaborate and to build relationships into the next stage.

                        Be sure to mark the date in your calendar and please stay safe and healthy until we meet at AOS
                        2022.
