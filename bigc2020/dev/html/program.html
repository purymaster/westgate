In 2009, the Swine flu, which killed about 200,000											people due to acute respiratory infections, recorded the second pandemic after the											launch of the WHO, and COVID-19 was declared the third pandemic, making it the first											worldwide infection of coronavirus. The number of deaths caused by COVID-19, which											exceeds 600,000 already, is still less than that of the Asian flu in 1958 and the											Hong Kong flu in 1968, where more than 1-2 million people died, but the sense of											fear is much greater now.<br>											Viruses that can spread to humans across species barriers, like as the influenza											viruses originating from wild birds and the coronaviruses derived from bats, have											already existed for a long time, and there will be countless types. These viruses											continue to adaptively evolve through point mutations and various recombination											events, and most of the time and conditions they encounter us are determined by											changes in our lifestyle. Before the Industrial Revolution, the border between wild											and civilization was relatively clear, but now we are crossing the border more often											at much more interfaces. While bacterial infections were the main cause of the											epidemic in the early days of urbanization, epidemics since the early 20th century,											when antibacterial agents were found, have been dominated by viruses, and the											interval between these epidemics is decreasing as rapidly as the border blurs. This											is evidenced by the fact that the majority of pathogens leading to notable epidemics											since the 20th century are zoonotic viruses. The characteristic of the zoonosis is											that the causative agents cannot be completely eradicated, and even if it can be											temporarily eliminated or contained, it is very likely to come back sooner or later.											In particular, RNA virus has a high probability of producing mutant strains, and 2-3											types of SARS-CoV-2, which were classified in the early stages of COVID-19, have											been diversified to 6 types in half a year. It is not yet known how these mutants											will affect this epidemic from an immunological and clinical point of view, but it											is time to pay special attention to changes in the genetic information of the virus.											While many Asian and European countries, which had experienced the early blast of											the epidemic, entered a relatively stable period at the moment, the incidence of											infection is still rising in the United States, South America, and Africa. This											regional time difference in the spread of epidemics, together with the newly emerged											viral variants, implies the possibility that the second and the third waves of											infection can continue at any time.<br>											Currently, more than 160 vaccine candidates are being developed worldwide to											restrict COVID-19, and about 20 of them are undergoing clinical trials. The											development period of the vaccine, which previously took an average of 10 years, has											been shortened to commercialization targets within 1-2 years through global											agreement and cooperation, and various antiviral drugs are also being retargeted.											This human effort will reduce the COVID-19 sacrifice, but it seems more likely to											convert to endemic disease rather than elimination. Soon, but other viruses are											waiting to appear on the stage and we have to prepare for them. The co-evolution											between humans and viruses will continue, but the number of the victims of the new											viral epidemics is entirely up to us.										</p>									</div>									<button type="button" class="close">Close Popup</button>								</div>							</div>							<!-- //pl1 abs -->							<!-- pl2 short -->							<div data-modal data-type="fix" id="pl2_sb">								<div class="modal">									<div class="txt_wrap">										<div class="modal_tit">Dr. Jerome H.

The coronavirus was officially named severe											acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee											on Taxonomy of Viruses based on phylogenetic analysis. Because the virus is highly											contagious, it rapidly spreads and continuously evolves in the human population.											This talk will discuss laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, including culture-based											virus isolation for evaluation of potential infectivity of clinical specimens and											viral genomic surveillance in Taiwan. Our results revealed that in addition to viral											RNA copy numbers, the integrity of the viral genome should be considered when											evaluating the infectivity of clinical specimens from COVID-19 patients. Sequence											analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in Taiwan reveals novel ORF-8 deletion mutant and clade											possibly associated with infections in middle East. Regarding the developments of											antiviral agents, clinical physician scientists at CGMH have obtained the											plasmablast-derived monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19-infected patients and											several antibodies have been identified to have great inhibitory effects on											different clades of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our team applied EditCell Virology											platform (genome-wide CRISPR-based system) to screen host factors that are important											for RNA virus replication.

All											viruses mutate over time, and this internal ‘molecular clock’ can be extremely											useful for scientists trying to understand the how, where, and when the virus has											spread. A vast majority of these genetic changes will be neutral, with no											significant impact on the virus or the host. Some of these genetic changes may be											detrimental to the virus, but these often escape notice as the viruses that contain											them fail to propagate. Under rare circumstances, however, a mutation will arise											that makes a virus better able to replicate and survive. Understanding the causes											and consequences of these mutations is important for informing vaccine development,											therapeutic design, clinical practice, and public health measures, but this can be a											significant challenge.<br><br>											In this presentation, we will explore how scientists are monitoring SARS-CoV-2											mutations and what we can learn from them, using my hometown, Chicago, Illinois,											USA, as an example. In collaboration with hospitals across the Chicago metropolitan											area, my lab has been working to determine the whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2											viruses from COVID-19 patients. These efforts have discovered a number of distinct											viral families or ‘clades’ circulating in the Chicago area, consistent with multiple											independent introductions of the virus over the course of several months. While two											of these clades reflect the epidemic elsewhere in the USA, New York and Washington											specifically, one of the clades appears relatively unique to Chicago and is very											closely related to the original viruses isolated from China. Over time, one of these											viral clades has become dominant not only across the city, but across the entire											globe, suggesting the emergence of a mutation that improves viral fitness. Indeed,											when we examine the clinical records of patients infected with viruses from this											clade, they have higher viral loads in their upper respiratory tract than other											COVID-19 patients. Fortunately, these viruses do not appear to be associated with											more severe disease or worse clinical outcome.<br><br>											While a lot more research needs to be done to determine the impact of these											mutations on viral replication and pathogenesis, they are already being used track											the movement of the virus and inform public health practices. Molecular and											structural modeling is likewise being used to predict whether any of these mutations											may provide resistance to therapeutics and vaccines currently under development. As											the pandemic continues, efforts to understand the causes and consequences of											SARS-CoV-2 mutations will likewise continue, providing important resources and											unique opportunities to combat this deadly disease.										</p>									</div>									<button type="button" class="close">Close Popup</button>								</div>							</div>							<!-- //s1-03 abs -->							<!-- s2-01 short -->							<div data-modal data-type="fix" id="s2-01_sb">								<div class="modal">									<div class="txt_wrap">										<div class="modal_tit">Ph.D. Jae-Ho Lee</div>										<div class="modal_subtit">Short Biography</div>										<p class="modal_subtxt">											2014.

A very rigorous program of contact tracing, isolation and quarantine as appropriate was instituted with widespread testing and use of molecular and serological tools to establish links between cases detected. This helped achieve good control through Feb and early March. Unfortunately, by end March, widespread outbreaks in migrant worker dormitories and elsewhere led to a significant lockdown which lasted two months before being lightened somewhat.

Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 and immediate isolation of infected patients from the susceptible population is important for preventing the spread of infection. The WHO recommends nucleic amplification tests for laboratory confirmation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Real-time RT-PCR is currently the most reliable diagnostic method for COVID-19. As of May 15, 2020, six real-time RT-PCR reagents have been approved for emergency use (emergency use authorization, EUA) in Korea. Recently, Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine (KSLM) and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) published guidelines for diagnosing COVID-19 in clinical laboratories in Korea. The guidelines include the selection of test subjects, selection of specimens, diagnostic methods, interpretation of test results, and biosafety. However, many practical and technical issues are frequently inquired, regarding nucleic acid extraction, nucleic acid amplification reagents, and interpretation of test results. Here, I would like to review the COVID-19 diagnostics and provide supplementary information to the practical issues and solutions to COVID-19 real-time RT-PCR testing.

With the increasing awareness of vaccine safety, conjugate vaccines have become attractive for vaccine design. For successful conjugate vaccines, the immunogenic carrier moiety is critical. Previously, we have demonstrated that bacteriophage Qbeta nanoparticles are a class of powerful immune carrier. In this talk, we will present our results in using Qbeta for the development of new glycoconjugate based anti-Salmonella vaccines.<br><br>											Salmonella infections (salmonellosis) are a major public health problem throughout the world. Conventionally, invasive Salmonella infections are treated with antimicrobial agents. However, the overuse of antibiotics in medicine as well as in livestock rearing has led to the emergence of multidrug resistant strains, prompting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to designate Salmonella as a pathogen of serious concern in their report on antimicrobial threats in the USA. Despite the frequency and severity of non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) diseases, no licensed human NTS vaccines are available yet. There is an urgent need to develop an NTS vaccine that could complement other control and prevention strategies.<br><br>											There are multiple strains of NTS Salmonella, including Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella paratyphi A, and Salmonella typhimurium. The O-polysaccharides on these bacteria share a common polysaccharide backbone consisting of a trisaccharide repeat unit, which is further modified with a characteristic deoxy sugar unit. Our first generation vaccine focuses on targeting the tetrasaccharide characteristic of each strain. Chemical syntheses have been performed to produce the antigenic determinant tetrasaccharide associated with Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella paratyphi A. The tetrasaccharides were then covalently conjugated with a powerful carrier, bacteriophage Qbeta. High levels of specific and long-lasting anti-glycan IgG antibodies were induced by the conjugate, which completely protected mice from lethal bacterial challenge in a passive transfer model. Glycan profiling of the antibodies produced indicated exquisite structural selectivities against the immunizing antigens. These results have provided exciting leads for the creation of new anti-Salmonella vaccines.										</p>									</div>									<button type="button" class="close">Close Popup</button>								</div>							</div>							<!-- //s3-06 abs -->							<!-- s4-01 short -->							<div data-modal data-type="fix" id="s4-01_sb">								<div class="modal">									<div class="txt_wrap">										<div class="modal_tit">Prof. Insuk Cheong</div>										<div class="modal_subtit">Short Biography</div>										<p class="modal_subtxt">											- BA and MA at Seoul National University, majoring Economics<br>											- Ph.D. at Princeton University in Economics<br>											- Spent two years at KISDI, Korean government think-tank for telecommunication and IT policy<br>											- Professor of Economics at HUFS from year 1997<br>											- Former president of Korea Academic Society for Industrial Organization<br>											- Current president of Korea Society for Bioeconomy<br>											- Has published academic papers in the fields of Industrial economics, innovation, regulations										</p>									</div>									<button type="button" class="close">Close Popup</button>								</div>							</div>							<!-- //s4-01 short -->							<!-- s4-01 abs -->							<div data-modal data-type="fix" id="s4-01_ab">								<div class="modal">									<div class="txt_wrap">										<div class="modal_tit">Prof. Insuk Cheong</div>										<div class="modal_subtit">Abstract</div>										<p class="modal_subtxt">											&middot; Trend of diffusion of coronavirus and policy responses<br>											- Short history of the pandemic in Korea<br>											- Disease control policies: testing, contact tracing<br><br>											&middot; Economic impact and policy initiatives<br>											- Trends in macroeconomic indices: GDP, employment, trade<br>											- Stimulation packages<br><br>											&middot; Changes and issues in post-corona era<br>											- Untact digital society<br>											- Global value chain<br>											- Korean new-deal policy initiative: digital and green deal<br>											- R&D in bio-medical innovation										</p>									</div>									<button type="button" class="close">Close Popup</button>								</div>							</div>							<!-- //s4-01 abs -->							<!-- s4-03 short -->							<div data-modal data-type="fix" id="s4-03_sb">								<div class="modal">									<div class="txt_wrap">										<div class="modal_tit">Dr. Minsik Park</div>										<div class="modal_subtit">Short Biography</div>										<p class="modal_subtxt">											Dr. Park is a Chief Investment Officer at STIC ventures and leads bio-healthcare group at STIC.
