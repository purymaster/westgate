							The police must push forward digital innovation in every field of policing to respond to the remote
							civilization brought earlier by COVID-19. The Korean Police have already opened a new horizon of
							digital policing by expanding its remote, online services. The police capacity on the field will be
							notably enhanced by adopting cutting-edge technologies such as AI and Big-data.

								<p>
									The coronavirus pandemic, which struck the entire world, has changed our daily lives
									drastically. The new remote lifestyle has kept us inside our homes, and the fear of the
									spreading virus has made us close our borders. Ironically, this situation with technology
									development leads our life radius to become broader than ever. The super-connected and
									highly sophisticated society has come earlier than we anticipated due to the pandemic. In
									this 'new normal' era, a menace can be drawn upon humanity at all times.
								</p>
								<p>
									While the virus impedes contact with others and cross-border exchanges, it does not mean the
									importance of policing or the necessity of international police cooperation has faltered.
									The commitment of the police has been ceaseless so far despite new challenges brought by the
									pandemic. For instance, the police are facing a complex request to maintain a balance
									between civil rights and public health in the community lockdowns, the banishment of private
									gatherings, and privacy infringement for epidemiology investigation. Emerging crimes, such
									as fake news in social media, online scams, illegal trafficking on the dark web, requires
									the police to advance digital police innovation using big data, artificial intelligence, the
									Internet of Things (IoT), drones, blockchain, and more.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the dawn of this new era, when our world is struggling to recover from the devastating
									aftermath of COVID-19, sharing best practices and lessons learned are essential to overcome
									the emerging threats. The Korean National Police Agency (KNPA) plans to seek global
									solidarity and cooperation by hosting a meeting for police leaders worldwide to consider a
									new proactive and preventative policing paradigm. The host intends that the 2021
									International Police Summit (IPS) in Seoul build a consensus among the participating global
									police leaders on defining emerging threats and developing resilience strategies in law
									enforcement.

							<div class="txt_wrap">
								<p>
									The Korean National Police Agency (KNPA) hosted two international events gathering
									ministers, vice-ministers, and chiefs of police from 17 countries in 2015 and 28 countries
									and international organizations in 2019, respectively. The first meeting focused on
									bilateral cooperation among participants, while the second one opened discussions on new
									challenges to international police cooperation in a multilateral forum.
								</p>
								<p>
									Taking over the success of the previous events, the 2021 IPS in Seoul will provide
									participants with a unique opportunity to build a network, identify better ways to secure
									public safety and security, and recognize the need for international police cooperation.
