                            The Korean National Police Agency(KNPA) has been annually hosting the International
                            Symposium on
                            Cybercrime Response(ISCR) as a part of its effort to combat borderless cybercrime. Since its
                            initiation back in 2000, the ISCR has now established itself as one of the largest law
                            enforcement
                            symposiums in the area of cyber security. Mainly due to the outbreak of COVID-19 across the
                            world,
                            the ISCR 2021 will be operated in hybrid(online and offline) basis. All contents will be
                            available
                            from October 18th to 22nd, at the official website(<a href="https://iscr.cyber.go.kr/eng"
                                target="_blank" data-link>https://iscr.cyber.go.kr/eng</a>). Also the symposium
                            will be held on-site(Four Seasons Hotel in Seoul, Korea) from October 18th to 19th. Across
                            the
                            globe, addressing growing and evolving cybercrime amid these difficult times has become a
                            major
                            concern for law enforcement agencies and their partners. The KNPA and ISCR Secretariat
                            deeply
                            believe that the cooperation between multiple law enforcement agencies, as well as the
                            active
                            involvement of private sector and academia will strengthen us all in the fight against
                            cybercrime.
