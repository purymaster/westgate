                                <strong>Step2</strong>
                                When you enter Korea, you must carry and submit the original copy of your 'PCR-negative certificate' issued in advance by a medical organization acknowledged by the Korean missions in your home country. The list of the medical organization for the PCR test is posted on each embassy's website. The certificates are valid, only if issued within 72 hours before your departure time.

                                Upon entering Korea, you must undergo another PCR test and wait for the result in a designated accommodation around the airport. This process will take approximately 9 to 16 hours depending on your arrival time. If your flight arrives in the afternoon, you are advised to come to Korea on 19th September as the waiting time could be longer.

                                All entrants exempted from the quarantine must install a 'self-diagnosis mobile application' on their mobile devices for reinforced active monitoring by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The application is for you to report any COVID-19 symptoms voluntarily once a day during your stay in Korea.
