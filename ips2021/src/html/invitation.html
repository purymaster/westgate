                    Dear police leaders and colleagues around the world,
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please accept my sincerest appreciation and warmest welcome for you to come to the International
                    Police Summit (IPS) in Seoul, the Republic of
                    Korea, from 20th to 23rd October 2021. It is my greatest honor to invite you to this unique event
                    hosted by the Korean National Police Agency to share
                    a common understanding of the need for global partnership in policing. Primarily, the Summit will
                    provide a meaningful forum for police leaders
                    worldwide to resume international exchanges and expand cooperation to cope with new threats in the
                    new era where we have to live with COVID-19.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notably, the virus has caused rapid changes in many aspects of our lives. The police worldwide are
                    facing new challenges in the global crisis with the
                    advent of the new normal. In times of upheaval, we have to find a new approach to police activities,
                    which must be supported by sharing, solidarity, and
                    cooperation at the global level. I believe the 2021 IPS will be an excellent opportunity for all
                    participants for sustainable communication and friendship.
                </p>

                            The Republic of Korea will celebrate its 76th National Police Day during the
                            event. The Korean National Police will host other online and offline events
                            for the same week of the 2021 IPS, including the Korean Police World Expo,
                            the International Symposium on Cybercrime Response, and the International
                            CSI Conference and Exhibition. The participants in the 2021 IPS will also
                            have the opportunity to attend these events.
                        </p>

                            Ensuring continuous commitment of the Korean National Police working
                            together with you for world peace and safety, I look forward to meeting you
                            all soon.
