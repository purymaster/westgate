                            At the plenary meeting, the participants shared their views on promoting international
                            discussion on policing and law enforcement. They suggested that the global multi-lateral
                            summits should discuss security and policing issues more often, and sub-committees should be
                            established on international police cooperation. Using technology for smart policing was
                            essential, and countries should share their experiences and knowledge in this regard.
                            Participants also had bilateral talks on investigation cooperation, police training and
                            capacity building, and infrastructure development in law enforcement. They also agreed to do
                            more on deporting criminals and protecting foreign nationals.
                            The delegations also visited the Korea Police World Expo, where they showed much interest in
                            technology and equipment for smart policing.
