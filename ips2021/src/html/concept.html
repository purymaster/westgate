                    The police must push forward digital innovation in every field of policing to respond to the remote
                    civilization brought earlier by COVID-19. The Korean Police have already opened a new horizon of
                    digital policing by expanding its remote, online services. The police capacity on the field will be
                    notably enhanced by adopting cutting-edge technologies such as AI and Big-data.

                            The coronavirus pandemic, which struck the entire world, has changed our daily lives
                            drastically. The new remote lifestyle has kept us inside our homes, and the fear of the
                            spreading virus has made us close our borders. Ironically, this situation with technology
                            development leads our life radius to become broader than ever. The super-connected and
                            highly sophisticated society has come earlier than we anticipated due to the pandemic. In
                            this 'new normal' era, a menace can be drawn upon humanity at all times.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the virus impedes contact with others and cross-border exchanges, it does not mean the
                            importance of policing or the necessity of international police cooperation has faltered.
                            The commitment of the police has been ceaseless so far despite new challenges brought by the
                            pandemic. For instance, the police are facing a complex request to maintain a balance
                            between civil rights and public health in the community lockdowns, the banishment of private
                            gatherings, and privacy infringement for epidemiology investigation. Emerging crimes, such
                            as fake news in social media, online scams, illegal trafficking on the dark web, requires
                            the police to advance digital police innovation using big data, artificial intelligence, the
                            Internet of Things (IoT), drones, blockchain, and more.

                            In the dawn of this new era, when our world is struggling to recover from the devastating
                            aftermath of COVID-19, sharing best practices and lessons learned are essential to overcome
                            the emerging threats. The Korean National Police Agency (KNPA) plans to seek global
                            solidarity and cooperation by hosting a meeting for police leaders worldwide to consider a
                            new proactive and preventative policing paradigm. The host intends that the 2021
                            International Police Summit (IPS) in Seoul build a consensus among the participating global
                            police leaders on defining emerging threats and developing resilience strategies in law
                            enforcement.

                            The Korean National Police Agency (KNPA) hosted two international events gathering
                            ministers, vice-ministers, and chiefs of police from 17 countries in 2015 and 28 countries
                            and international organizations in 2019, respectively. The first meeting focused on
                            bilateral cooperation among participants, while the second one opened discussions on new
                            challenges to international police cooperation in a multilateral forum.

                            participants with a unique opportunity to build a network, identify better ways to secure
                            public safety and security, and recognize the need for international police cooperation.
