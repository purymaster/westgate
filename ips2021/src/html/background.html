                            The world is desperate to understand multifaceted social changes and respond to new challenges brought by the coronavirus pandemic. The New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman said, "There is the world B.C. — Before Corona — and the world A.C. — After Corona."<sup>1</sup>

                        <p style="text-indent:1em;">
                            Innovative approaches focusing on the future should enlighten the police as well. Policing in this era of new normal should proactively look into the changed surroundings, such as emerging crime trends, alterations in criminal justice, and different aspects of social conflicts. Simultaneously, they are required to develop a vision for the aftermath of the pandemic by realigning their roles and goals. For instance, the police are now one of the main actors in the pandemic control and should figure out how to reallocate their resources appropriately. This situation requires police organizations to provide a different range of services and enforcement, in addition to the current ones.

                        <p style="text-indent:1em;">
                            "Given the uncertainty and myriad challenges raised by pandemics, it is perhaps true to say that policing pandemics represents a new paradigm in policing."<sup>2</sup>
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent:1em;">
                            In this context, the International Police Summit (IPS) 2021 in Seoul aims at i) sharing experiences, issues, and achievements in each country and ii) developing proactive policing strategies for adaptation and prevention beyond just responding to a crisis.

                            <strong>Changes in policing environment.</strong> The contactless society facilitates our daily lives to go online on digital platforms. Similarly, in policing, the main venue of crime moves to online spaces. Taking advantage of state-of-the-art technologies, criminals have been creative in committing digital sextortion, cryptocurrency-related crimes, illicit activities on dark webs, and deepfake attacks. Victimization in cyberspaces becomes exponentially faster than ever. What happens online gets more influential to our community as we see the infodemic<sup>3</sup> led by false information or fake news on the disease. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent:1em;">
                            <strong>Expansion of police responsibility.</strong> In parallel, the police are expected to do more in the pandemic. The unprecedented threats of infectious disease make focusing on human security<sup>4</sup> more essential than ever. Socially vulnerable people have been exposed more than others to not only infection risks but also human rights violations, hate crimes, and discrimination. The United Nations Secretary-General Antόnio Guterres pointed out that “the pandemic has hit the poorest and most vulnerable in our societies hardest.”<sup>5</sup> The significant impact of the coronavirus pandemic has brought anxiety, distrust, hatred, and despair to individuals in their daily lives, which also adds fuel to the flame of extremism and hate crime. A recent study showed that anti-Asian hate crimes increased 164% in the first quarter of 2021 over the same period in 2020.<sup>6</sup>

                    Seeking a new policing strategy
                </h3>

                <div class="img_cont">

                            <strong>Pursuing sustainable security.</strong> German sociologist Ulrich Beck defines a risk society as "a systematic way of dealing with hazards and insecurities induced and introduced by modernization itself."<sup>7</sup> The coronavirus pandemic has proven that a regional crisis could become a global one unexpectedly fast in the modernized super-connected and extremely complex society. Communities should find a way to recover the damages and, simultaneously, enhance their capacity for a long-term comprehensive strategy, blocking social risk factors. This means that the police should support the recovery and security of the community while developing a long-term strategy for their capacity to prevent the same crisis from happening. Now is the time to promote strategic resilience for our community, which means responding flexibly to crises and improving structural insecurity. It would be possible by seizing opportunities amid the crisis and adopting innovative measures for sustainability.

                        <p style="text-indent:1em;">
                            <strong>Open to technology.</strong> The police need to adopt the latest technologies, including artificial intelligence and big-data analysis to cope with the emerging criminal trends. Many countries have developed a digital transformation strategy for policing and law enforcement. For example, the UK National Police Technology Council announced the Digital, Data and Technology Strategy 2030<sup>8</sup> last year. The National Cyber Strategy of the US Government stressed combating cybercrime and improving incident reporting in cooperation with private sectors and partner countries.<sup>9</sup> The Korean Police are also creating a data hub linking private and public databases for big data analysis to support decision-making processes in police policies.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent:1em;">
                            <strong>Improving public trust in policing.</strong> There has been criticism against traditional responsive policing focusing only on crime reduction. The police should be a problem solver, more than a crime fighter in the current environment with the ongoing risks. They are requested to practice proactive and preventative policing with professionalism and expertise. In addition, diversity and inclusion should be considered essential in all aspects of policing. Just and fair application of the law by the police could lead to the recognition and reliance of the public, which also brings a virtuous cycle of public compliance. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent:1em;">
                            <strong>Global Solidarity and Cooperation. </strong> The international community calls for a global alliance, stressing cooperation among countries to defeat the disease and its negative impact. Each country should go beyond nationalism. The United Nations Secretary-General said “no single country can address pandemics and global health emergencies alone.”<sup>10</sup> Henry Kissinger, the former US Secretary of State, pointed out that “no country, not even the U.S., can in a purely national effort overcome the virus. Addressing the necessities of the moment must ultimately be coupled with a global collaborative vision and program.”<sup>11</sup> Shared vision and willingness to cooperate are critical in solving the global crisis. Some organizations, such as the United Nations,<sup>12</sup> INTERPOL,<sup>13</sup> and the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP),<sup>14</sup> have considered ways to overcome the crisis by suggesting standards and introducing best police practices in response to the pandemic. The Korean Police have also tried not to lose momentum for international cooperation by promoting alternative ways of its K-Cop Wave Program. The Program adopted a remote business model under the restriction on physical access, conducting online training courses on advanced police technologies and expertise. The Korean Police also published a digital booklet<sup>15</sup> to introduce their experiences and measures against COVID-19 and share them through international webinars and conferences.<sup>16</sup>
